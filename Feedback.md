Great work on drawCircles- caught all the bugs. There's an extra turtle (my_turtle) in the drawTree file, but you just use turtle, so that could be removed. Great work on making a function definition! More documentation of what your methods are doing would be helpful. Good job on the mysteryScript, you gave a very detailed breakdown of what each line was doing. For search (q1drone), there was a small syntax error at the very beginning that prevented the code from running, so just be sure to double check that your code will run before doing that final push. Your code works well otherwise. Variable names in Python should be all lowercase, i.e. center_of_y instead of Center_of_y.  As for randomSquares, the code works well. More documentation throughout the file would be helpful. Also, your square length is 20, and the homework asks for 25. You can use screen size instead of -250, 250 to generate squares on the entire canvas. Overall, your code works great, as intended, but be sure to document what your methods are doing, and review naming conventions for variables. Great work using a function definition, too!
